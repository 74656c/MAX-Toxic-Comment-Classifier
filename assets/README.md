## Model files

The original pre-trained model files are from the [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) repository, where they are available under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/LICENSE). This pre-trained model was then finetuned on the [Toxic Comment Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

_Note: the finetuned model files are hosted on [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/max-assets-prod/max-toxic-comment-classifier/1.0.0/assets.tar.gz)._
